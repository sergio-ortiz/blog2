### Wednesday 4/24/2024 - Happy Birthday Dad!
from now till the end of the month you have to make your remote work worth while,
meaning I have to make my efforts in modernizing bioethx.org recognized and desired.
My hopes are that this will aid in my physical abscence from the office while im doing something for my dj career miami for a week.
Use pomodoro to do planks and do 12-3-30 before and after work.

Also, I love J Balvin! 🇨🇴
, he is underrated since 2022.
