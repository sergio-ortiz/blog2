#### I want to say that im going to research using htmx in astro, if its feasible cool if not we will just move on to migrating sites from Next to Astro nd then from CSS to Tailwind w/ taking a tailwind course in between.

I want to say that my application development architecture has gone and will probably continue to go something like this:

1. html, css, js + node + heroku + mongo
2. Next.js + prisma "heroku postgres" + css modules + netlify
3. php&mysql + Bootstrap&Sass + lamp
4. SvelteKit + vercel postgres "neon" + DaisyUI + vercel
5. Astro + PicoCSS + libsql + drizzle
---
6. Bun + Hono + htmx + PicoCSS + sqlite + docker
7. Go + PicoCSS + turso
