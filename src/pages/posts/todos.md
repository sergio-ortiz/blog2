### Tuesday 5/14/2024 - half way through figuring how to change where I am

1. [ ] build location tracking app w/ astro + Pico CSS
2. [ ] Migrate Next.js sites to astro
3. [ ] set up contactless pay on android
4. [ ]  set up db in astro to track check ins
5. [ ] learn agile "manifesto"
6. [ ] learn project management on github
7. [ ] learn testing mocha and chai, vitest, bun:test, node assert
8. [ ] set up serato on fake macbook for djing this weekend at big name's in local hiphop space dmv

I want to say that my application development architecture has gone and will probably continue down something like this:

1. html, css, js + node + heroku + mongo
2. Next.js + prisma "heroku postgres" + css modules + netlify
3. php&mysql + Bootstrap&Sass + lamp
4. SvelteKit + vercel postgres "neon" + DaisyUI + vercel
5. Astro + PicoCSS + libsql + drizzle

6. Bun + Hono + htmx + PicoCSS + sqlite + docker
7. Go + PicoCSS + turso
