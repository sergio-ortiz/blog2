# build Drupal projects, host them on AWS, and Secure them

I started my IT/Developer Journey in 2018/2019.
I was asked to learn Drupal and in order to learn Drupal the official site stated that I had to have prerequisite knowledge.
The prerequisite knowlege goes as follows in this order:

1. HTML & CSS
2. JavaScript
3. Bootstrap, Sass, jQuery
4. PHP & MySQL

I dont remember whether this was officially listed but I know that Drupal is a Lamp Stack application and therefore you must be proficient in Linux and most likely a Red Hat based distribution.
So this is where I am on this journey, I am dangerous in Linux, HTML, CSS and, JavaScript, I am becoming dangerous with Bootstrap, Sass and, jQuery and I have knowlege of PHP and little experience in MySQL though more experience in MS-SQL, Postgres and, SQLite respectively.
I have earned freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification and freeCodeCamp's (New) Responsive Web Design cerification which concern themselves with JavaScript and HTML & CSS respectively.
I am currently working on freeCodeCamp's Front End Developer Libraries certification. I've completed all the lessons, over 100, and I have to build 5 projects. I am currently on the fourth out of 5.
All of freeCodeCamp's certifications consist of the same, over 100 lessons to be completed and 5 projects to build. I want to go over the Whole Sass course and then go through the Bootstrap Docs just to feel like I really understand them before moving on.
the Front End Libraries certification covers and actually focuses on React w/ Redux so I could also solidify My knowlege on React and Redux but since its not necessary for becoming a drupal guy then I'll do it on the side.
I would do this by going to legacy.reactjs.org docs and completing "Guide to Main Concepts" and "Thinking in React" and also the "Redux Essentials tutorial" and the "Redux Fundamentals tutorial"
After I earn freeCodeCamp's Front End Developer Libraries certification, I will move on to becoming comfortable with PHP & MySQL. I will start with Traversy Media's PHP Crash Course on youtube.
Then I will go through the Reputable Jon Duckett's PHP & MySQL: Server-Side Web Development Book. After this maybe build a toy project or two I will Move on to Drupal development.
I have a Raspberry Pi 3b+ and Rocky Linux, which is a bug for bug clone of RHEL without all the trademarking, has an installation image compatible with my Pi. I should go through an installation and then start learning.
