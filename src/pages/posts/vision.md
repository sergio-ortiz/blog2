I have a lot of pride in my Colombian heritage. Arepas, cafe, la belleza, la cultura, more specifically the Music. Vallenato, cumbia, salsa, pop, juanes, carlos vives, shakira, bacilos, fonseca, cabas, fanny lu, champeta, reggaeton, j balvin, maluma, sebastian yatra, manuel turizo, karol g, feid. 

My dad is from Ecuador but he is the one that really taught me about club music as young as 5 years of age. All the house/techno/electronic and hip hop from the 90s to early 2000s.

anywho I am seeing something in the Colombian club scene as of late that feels as if it was made for me.

In my opinion the electronic music that is most palatable for humans seems to be house.
I love house but man what if it was techno or wubs, that would be amazing.

Latin Tech House has become part of the meta recently. I will refer to this as latin house.

#### Exhibit A
For me the leader in the space is hugel. Now hugel along with other djs that have made awesome latin house tracks heavily rely on Colombian folk singers for the melodies that make each track special.

#### Exhibit B
Carlos Vives, Colombian national treasure vallenato pop star has recently collaborated on an official latin house version of fruta fresca. it's quite good actually.

#### Exhibit C
Feid, the new man carrying the reggaeton scene in Colombian forward, that in my experience djing has been requested just as much as bad bunny as of late. Feid has officially released two latin house tracks "not remixes". They are both really good actually.

#### Exhibit D
Shakira's latest 2024 album has had a lot of dance beats but one in my book one track is fully latin house and the production is a collaborative effort between Bizzarap and TiÃ«sto. the song is actually really good.
