- version control dotfiles: ln, gnu-stow, git-bare + backup system, could help with setup automation?
- Set up BlackArch "penetration testing" repository
- VirtualBox, cli, whonix, vagrant, metasploitable, metasploit framework
- become dangerous in bash and automate setup, and other scripting languages: node, ruby, lua, go. automate everything.
